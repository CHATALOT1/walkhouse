# Campaign Overview

## Summary of important things

### The flash of light

The party saw a flash of light in session 1 which in session 2 they will realise is actually very far away. They will spend many sessions (a whole journey) on their way to this flash of light, and meet many cool people along the way.

## Ideas to implement at some point

- Somebody (baddie?) has befriended one of Basilia's close moths and turns out the moth has been informing on the party
  - Potentially dangerous idea; don't want to make the party feel too important or big within the world.
- Blacksmith that used to make weapons (alluded to but not initially directly stated) now makes only kind things and small devices for children as a way of repentance
- Basilia delivering her packages
  - A wax-sealed love letter......for a witchy and shrewish witch deep in the Miremuck Swamp.
  - A book with dangerous and illicit information......for a furious spy in a distant city.
  - A basket of homemade candies......for the proper mayor of a hidden village.
- Both Basilia and Rachel are former revolutionaries from the same revolution but they don't yet know this about eachother, find a way to make them realise this
  - They meet their former commander?
