# Walkhouse campaign planning and GM notes

## What is this repo?

This repo is for the Walkhouse campaign of Wanderhome which I (@CHATALOT1) am running.

There is no code in this repo, it simply serves to be an archive and backup and an easy way for me to share my campaign planning with others and ask for help/advice or give them inspiration.

**I would not recommend that you read any file other then this one in this repo if you are a member of the campaign party, there will be spoilers.** _(This may include files for sessions we have already played)_

## Where should i get started reading through this repo?

This repo is mainly assorted notes and plans i have written for myself.

If i have asked you to help me with planning a session, I recommend you look at the `ending.md` files in the last session(s) and especially the `general.md` file for the next session. It is also worth reading the [Campaign Overview](overview.md), especially the first section ([Summary of important things](overview.md#summary-of-important-things))

If you wish to look through this repository for another reason (e.g. inspiration, curiosity), I recommend starting with the aforementioned [Campaign Overview](overview.md) and proceeding to read through the individual sessions' `general.md` and then `ending.md`, starting with [Session 1](Sessions/Session-1/general.md). I will be adding information about the player characters/recurring NPCs in [the Characters folder](Characters/) at some point in the near future. I may also add art drawn by the players here (with their consent). You could also check out any supplementary resources included in session folders.

## Which session are you currently on and when do you play?

We play at 5pm UK time (GMT or BST) every Wednesday. The next session will be session 2

## Do you record your sessions?

We do, but currently these are **not** published publicly as agreed by the group as a whole.
