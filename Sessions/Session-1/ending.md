# Session 1 Ending

> The hallucinogenic mushroom session

This session took approximately 80 minutes.

As mentioned in [this session's overview](general.md), I didn't plan this session, so everything was very improvised.

## Relevant to future sessions

- Saw big flash of light (see [The flash of light](../../overview.md#the-flash-of-light)))
- Met Bobby the baby raccoon (Character overview coming at some point to [the Characters folder](../../Characters/))
- Aurora was _not_ included in this session (The party member playing her was invited to join between Session 1 and 2) however the rest of the party did meet in this session

## General order of things that actually happened

1. There was a heavy blizzard outside which Sage and Rachel were caught up in.
2. Sage bumped into Rachel as they were both trying to find shelter.
3. They found a cave shortly, Rachel got her big bee to push the boulder blocking it aside
4. This revealed Basilia who was napping with her moths.
5. Basilia woke and they spoke for a short while
6. Sage ate one of the glowing mushrooms on the wall and was promptly very sick.
7. After this, they decided to explore the cave further, feeling strange as they inhaled the spores of the mushrooms all over the cave wall/ceiling
8. They hallucinated a hermit for a while and Sage tried to steal the hermit's non-existant pot of glowing mushroom soup, which they had all previously refused to drink
9. As they went deeper into the cave, they saw a big and scary shadow begin to emerge.
10. This shadow turned out to be a small baby raccoon that has since been named "Bobby" and is travelling with the party as a recurring NPC.
11. Shortly after befriending Bobby, they must have inhaled spores of a different mushroom as they all felt drowsy and quickly Basilia was curled up and asleep with her moths, Rachel was curled up and asleep with her bees and Sage was curled up and asleep with Bobby and their giant african land snail.
12. When they awake, they venture back out of the cave and see the blizzard completely stopped. and are in a very open grassy area.
13. Suddenly, there is a great flash of light in the distance.
14. Sage immediately runs after the light, and Basilia calls out "Sage!" from behind.
15. The _Seinfeld_ theme plays (I played it with a music bot within the call).
