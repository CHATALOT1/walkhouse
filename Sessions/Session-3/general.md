# Session 3

**To be written**

TODO: At some point, be sure to include a variation of the following steps to allow Aurora to join the group:

1. Suddenly, they realise Bobby has scampered off and gone missing!
2. Let them panic
3. Prompt Aurora to do as we planned between sessions: Emerge, looking for Bobby's parents.
4. Allow for conversation as they meet Aurora, Aurora is now in the party.
