# Session 3 Ending

> The tree diplomacy session

This session took 3 hours to complete

## General order of things that actually happened

1. Both Basilia and Rachel (on big bee) flew up to check where the party was in the Green Way and both came to the conclusion they were in the centre
2. They also noticed it was dusk, and decided to sleep in a particularly tall tree, taking turns to keep watch as they were suspicious of the place.
3. On Rachel's watch, during the sunrise, she noticed shadows moving below and eventually decided to have big bee take her down onto the ground to investigate.
4. She noticed that a small tree next to the tree they were sleeping in was glowing, and had a face on it.
5. She and the tree (Jimmy) talked for a short amount of time before she waked up the others.
6. Sage made the tree cry briefly, but her and Basilia promptly fixed it and they begin to listen to it's tale in exchange for directions.
7. Jimmy told them more about the folklore of the green way (namely reinforcing the idea that the trees moved there), but didn't know much as he was only ten. He then proceeded to talk about how boring the other trees were and how they had non-representative politics before giving them directions to Tree Town.
8. They arrived in Tree Town but suddenly, as they approached the hustle and bustle of the village, they noticed Bobby had gone missing. Panic ensued.
9. Flynn emerged holding Bobby and looking for his carers. The party met Flynn, the mayor of Tree Town.
10. The party explored the village. They found lodging at Joseph the blacksmith's forge and Sage attempted to steal an apple but failed as it was free.
11. The party were taken by Flynn to the town hall to engage in the activites run by Flynn every night before the town goes to sleep.
