# Session 2 Ending

> The squirrel distribution session

This session took upwards of an hour and a half

## Relevant to future sessions

- Found out that the [flash of light](../../overview.md#the-flash-of-light) is actually very far away (several settlements and a large mass of water in the way)
- Basilia and Rachel had a distant discussion about a revolutionary war they discovered that they both participated in as rebels long long ago.
- Gained items from Randy Jane the travelling distributor squirrel
  - Sage got Bobby a **many-coloured small scarf**
  - Sage gained **many shiny stones** that Sage does not know the name of
  - Basilia got an **extremely rust shovel**
  - Rachel got a lot of daisy-like **multicoloured flowers** and distributed them among her bees for food and decoration.
- The party (especially Basilia) are very interested in the stones along the Green Way, there is no or little mystery to do with them

## General order of things that actually happened

- I can't remember the specifics of a lot of what happened now at the time of writing this and am too lazy to re-listen to the recordings and note it all down, sorry.
