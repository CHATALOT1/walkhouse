# Session 2

## General order of important things

1. Wrap up some stuff from the end of session 1
   - what was Rachel trying to do with the bee?
     - 'intercept' Sage?
2. Play _Spongebob_ "Many, Many Minutes Later" sound effect (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yVTFXidDvs)
3. Sage, Basilia, Rachel now in new place. Travelling down The [Green Way](../../Places/green-way.md)
4. Allow for some conversation between them
5. Mention the numbered stones dotting the Green Way as they walk
6. Meet/see some of the following while travelling in order to prompt players to lead the story. Have the first or second of these encounters tell the players that the flash of light is in fact very far away, or allude to it (as this is something the players did not yet know).

   - A friendly caravan of beetles led by a travelling squirrel
   - A stream that intersects with the road (a bridge is built to cross it) for when the players get thirsty
   - Small bugs seemingly arguing over territory
   - Someone who talks about one of the folklore
   - One of the trees suddenly talks to them as mentioned in [a piece of Green Way folklore](../../Places/green-way.md#the-forest-spirits-and-their-mockery)

7. They realise they have come across one of the numbered stones they saw hours and hours ago as it gets dark (They saw it before step 6)
8. (Optional) Allow for discussion
9. End session
