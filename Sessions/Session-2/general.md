## General order of important things

1. Wrap up some stuff from the end of session 1
   - what was Rachel trying to do with the bee?
     - 'intercept' Sage?
2. Play _Spongebob_ "Many, Many Minutes Later" sound effect (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yVTFXidDvs)

6. Let them panic
7. Prompt Aurora to do as we planned between sessions: Emerge from the trees, looking for Bobby's parents.
8. Allow for conversation as they meet Aurora, Aurora is now in the party. Aurora is aware that the flash of light is extremely far away, which is something the rest of the party have not yet realised.
9. Mention the numbered stones dotting the Green Way as they walk
10. Meet/see some of the following while travelling in order to prompt players to lead the story

    - A stream that intersects with the road (a bridge is built to cross it) for when the players get thirsty
    - Small bugs seemingly arguing over territory
    - Someone who talks about one of the folklore
    - One of the trees suddenly talks to them as mentioned in [a piece of Green Way folklore](../../Places/green-way.md#the-forest-spirits-and-their-mockery)

11. They realise they have come across one of the numbered stones they saw hours and hours ago as it gets dark (They saw it before step 10)
