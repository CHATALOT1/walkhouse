# Session 2 Place: The Green Way

> "Oh, have you ever seen a forest so alive and yet so peaceful? A road of joy this one." - Little Red the young salamander

Natures: **Wilderness**, **Road**, **Glen**

## Aesthetic Elements

- Many flying buzzing insects such as dragonflies
  - Few other sounds
- Gravel Path that forks at many points in both directions
- The path is old and there are often bumps or dips in it
- There are stones every few miles, engraved into them is the text "The Green Way" followed by a large number. Most people don't really know what the numbers mean anymore, but they're useful in some ways anyway. The stone at the centre of the path is labelled with the number zero.
- The road is often walked but due to it being so long and forking, you are only likely to bump into others every 2-4 hours.

## Folklore

### The Day the Woods Walked

It is said that this forest moved long ago to where it is now, and that around the path used to just be plains. There are some that believe it was more then plains, and that once this was a thriving metropolis... Until the woods walked here...

### The forest spirits and their mockery

It is said that all the trees here have a spirit, but that they are more apart then the spirits of other forests and in fact often have debates about how to handle their political issues. These spirits used to, for the most part, hate outsiders and employed various tactics to get them to leave including mocking them until they got upset and left. Some even going so far as to scare them away. Nowadays their society is much more accepting of outsiders, and instead largely opt not to interact with them, as they still don't want their affairs meddled with. There are some young trees however, who still like to talk to strangers...
