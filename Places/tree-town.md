# Tree Town

> "I like it here, in this hidden and proper village. We have all we need and more, even the tree spirits will talk to us sometimes! I like running this place..." - Flynn, Mayor of Tree Town

First introduced: [Session 3](../Sessions/Session-3/general.md)

Natures: **Workshop**, **Garden**, **Glen**

This place is hidden comfortably within [the Green Way](green-way.md)

## Aesthetic Elements

- One of the most well-known and often-visited buildings in the city is the relatively small forge, run by a mysterious small badger named Joseph.
  - Joseph makes many metal things for everyone in the village, especially the children. This is his way of repentance for the weapons he used to create, although he doesn't tell that to just anyone.
- The other most well-known and often-visited building is the Town Hall, home of the hedgehog Mayor, Flynn.
  - There are many fun activities at the Town Hall including games made of metal by Joseph
  - There is always a healthy supply of apples along with a few other fruits in the Hall.
- The dragonflies of the green way buzz everywhere here as well.

## Folklore and secrets

### Flynn

The mayor, Flynn, is always chirpy and 'proper', loving to organise events and make people happy. However, Flynn is secretly overwhelmed and exhausted by all this hard work but rarely expresses this to anyone (and never in public!). Flynn needs and deserves a break, but won't let themself have one.

Basilia has a package for Flynn, a basket of homemade candies.

### Joseph

Joseph used to make weapons. The fact that he did this boils his blood and he struggles not to dislike himself over it. He acts chirpy, just like the mayor, but has many intrusive thoughts most of the time and fears actuating them, even though he never would. You'd have to get to know him in order for him to express any of this to you.

### The old tree in the centre of town, always ripe with apples

It is said a small god lives in this tree, keeping it healthy all through the seasons, and keeping the villagers fed with endless apples. Nobody is sure why she chooses to feed this town in particular, but they are all greatful. One cunning and intelligent koala child is close to figuring it out, however.
